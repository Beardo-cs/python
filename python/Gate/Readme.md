**Using the understanding from the above activity solve the following problems**

- Research other types of gates that exist (such as NAND, NOR, and
XOR). Add them to the circuit hierarchy. How much additional coding
did you need to do?
- The most simple arithmetic circuit is known as the [half-adder](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/half-adder-in-digital-logic/).
Research the simple half-adder circuit. Implement this circuit.
- Now extend that circuit and implement an 8 bit [full-adder](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/full-adder-in-digital-logic/).
